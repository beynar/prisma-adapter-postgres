Writting the adapter

I need an adapter for prisma that works with the postgres lib (not node-pg or pg). 

I already started the work based on pglite-adapter folder.

You will need to help me built it and be as close as possible from the other official adapters to avoid errors. 

The documentation of postgres is inside [postgres.doc.md](mdc:postgres.doc.md) 

The implementation details are in [IMPLEMENTATION.md](mdc:IMPLEMENTATION.md)

Do not edit any other files than those present in the postgres-adapter folder or in the tests folder. Your only task is to make the postgres-adapter works an follow the guideline of implementing an adapter for prisma like the already built and functional ones in the other-adapter folder. 
Let's do it bro !
